Inspiration References
Style Vibe: Think of the elegance of Medium (reading experience), the intuitiveness of Spotify (audio), the engagement of Duolingo (gamification), and the spiritual serenity of apps like Abide or Pray.com, but with a more modern, sleek edge.
Avoid: Outdated, cluttered, overly "churchy" designs with excessive religious imagery. We want contemporary and inviting, not dated or exclusive.

Additional Notes

The app will be built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) for cross-platform compatibility
Must feel premium but accessible - not overly commercial
Should appeal to all ages (Gen Z to Boomers), with special attention to family features
Performance is critical - design with load times and optimization in mind
Consider offline states and how the UI adapts when content isn't available
